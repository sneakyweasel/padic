# P-adic number

## Algorithm

### Cleanest implementation

- Cleanest algorithm is long division with loop detection.

### Current implementation

- Actually using RosettaCode followed by longest repeating sequence detection

## P-adic distance

- P-adic distance is the most interesting element to implement.
